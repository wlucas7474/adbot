## Installation

In WSL, Linux, or macOS:

    git clone git@github.com:wlucas7474/adbot.git

May need to set up an SSH key with GitHub. Use `ssh-keygen` to generate key, find your public key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and paste that into GitHub (Settings->SSH and GPG keys->New SSH key).

## Running the bot

Replace the `config.json.template` file with your own `config.json` file.

Ensure you have Python 3 with `python3 --version` or `python --version`. Install it if you don't have it.

Run the following:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 bot.py
```

The bot should now be running!

Anytime you need to rerun the bot you should only need to `Ctrl+C` to stop the bot's running, and can do `python3 bot.py` to start it again.
